## Description

### Summary 
Be organized throughout for your day. This application features time blocks for you to input whatever notes you would like for each hour of the regular 9-5 job day. This website features color coding blocks based on the actual time it is. Red means we are in that hour block during the time of the day, green mean those hours have not come yet but will be soon, and grey is the past times. Your notes won't be gone once you reload the page, the website stores your inputs and renders them back to your page through the browsers local storage. Once you hit the save button (It is with a lock icon on each time block) the application will save your inputs to the local storage. Easy functionality to schedule your working days.
